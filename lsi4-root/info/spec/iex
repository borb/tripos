Form:           IEX  "dir,to/k,titles/s,nodates/s,puid/s"
Purpose:        To examine a directory interactively
Author:         PBr

Examines the files in the directory dir.

If to is quoted the output is send to file

If Titles is quoted, only the filetitles are given

Specification:
   Similar to EX, but it is interactive and prompts after each file.
   The reply to each prompt is read up to a non letter, and the word is
uppercased. Unless the word then matches one of the options below, an error is
given. A match occurs if the word is a leading (sub)string of an option, with at
least the chracters that are in capitals.
   Thus 'ex' matches 'Examine'

   Some options, those with a (-) after them, recognise a '-' before the option
to negate the action.

   The options are:
  <cr>          Go on to next entry
  ?             Type list of options
  *             Return to beginning of this directory
  !             Send rest of line To CLI. '^' is substituted by the file name

  EXAll         EXALL the current directory
  Full (-)      Type full file information
  Help          Type a list of options
