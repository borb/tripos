If IBM is quoted it is more 'STANDARD'.  This means that the names
are made to be capitals and all files start "./ ADD NAME=".
THIS MAY CAUSE ERRORS.  If there are two files with similar final
names, the destination program may loose data.

the directory depth.  It also adds n dots before any lines beginning
with some dots followed by "/ ".
Each directory has begins with its own name, and wnds up with a
"./ ENDUP".
