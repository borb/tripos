Welcome to TRIPOS running on the Cambridge Processor Bank.  If you have not
yet obtained the booklet "Tripos Newcomer's Guide and General Documentation",
then you should see NJO, who will give you one.  You are strongly advised to
read this document before attempting to do useful work.  Help is available
through the HELP command  -  try "HELP <item>" if you are having problems.

General information for new users can be obtained with "HELP NOVICE".  This
contains indirections to many other parts of the HELP system, and should keep
you busy for a while.

The following commands may be useful to you:

    PASSWORD SET           Set a new logon password  (see HELP PASSWORD)
    MAILBOX CREATE         Create a mailbox          (see HELP MAIL)

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Tripos does not clear up its temporary files for you!
                 See HELP TEMPORARY FILES for info.
