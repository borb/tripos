SEND USER=USERS=INITIALS,(from=stream|/k),CC/K,BCC/K,ABOUT=SUBJECT/K,NONE/S
[,file/k]                                           Send mail to a list of users


        The user argument is a list of recipients, separated by spaces or commas
Each recipient may be the initials of a user known by the MAP service, or a
distribution list. MAP is tried first, but if that fails, then the sender's own
distribution list and the system disitribution list are scanned.

    If no user list is given, then the sender is prompted for the various
possible headers, and then types the body of the message.

    CC and BCC are Carbon Copies and Blind Carbon Copies.

    If no subject field is given, the user will be prompted until a string is
given. If this consists of spaces, it will be discarded.

    NONE tells the program not to read from the terminal even if no file is
given.

[    The TRIPOS COMMAND version allows a file title to be specified, in which
  case that file is sent.  [ The testing vesrions allow pasing the file by puid
    or passing a stream, i.e. a stream is read into a file, and the file sent by
    puid ]
  Note that as immutable files are not yet implemented, the file should be
  deleted
  or not modified.
]
    Note that users may not see the mail immediately as the MAILSERVER caches
the master tables.
