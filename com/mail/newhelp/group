GROUP [edit|create|delete|list|help] "group,system/s"
                                                   Manipulate Distibution Groups

        This command may only be used from the Dynamic Mailserver

        The GROUP identifier can only be omitted with the LIST command, which
    means give a list of names of the distribution groups.

        SYSTEM indicates that the system groups should be inspected, rather than
    the user's private list.

        CREATE and DELETE add and remove a distribution list.  The name must be
    less than 13 characters long.

        LIST with a group name will list the members of a group.

        EDIT will allow editing of a single group. It has its own HELP facility.
