UNDELETE                                                  Recover from deletions

        The DELETE command marks the specified item as 'due for deletion', but
the item is still there until the COMPRESS demon next runs.     It is therefore
possible to recapitulate before the demon is started.   As the demon runs
asynchronously there is no assurance that the item has not been purged, so do
NOT rely on this facility  --  however it will often work.
        As there is no way of indicating which deleted item is to be
resurrected, all deleted mail is returned.
