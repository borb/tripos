FORWARD ITEM[/A],USER,ABOUT=SUBJECT/K[,from=file/k]          Forward a mail item

        This is similar to send, except that the text of text and header of the
message is the specified mail item, with any added fields appended.

        If a current message is selected, then ITEM defaults to that value.

        If the first item is not a number, or a single letter, it is assumed to
be a user id, and the current item is used.
