TESTING CODE:   Use SYS TESTMAIL or TRIPOS command TEST.MAIL.

This is list of diferences between the standard and testing versions.
The order is approximately chronological, but some differnces have changed.

Thoughts of 11 Jun 82:
-----------------------
With the advent of PUBLIC mail, it is now possible to have junk TRIPOS mail, as
the current TRIPOS message system already has.  If all mail sent to it is marked
PUBLIC then anyone can LOOKAT it. This still needs the much awaited timeout
mechanism to discrd it.

I have also introduced the idea of a MBOX which is an object of the same
structure as each user's mail directory.  These may be stored in a user's mail
directory, and there are commands MOVE and COPY to manipulate mail between
mboxes.  Thus all mail relating to a certain subject may be dumped to a relevant
mbox.  The MBOX command may then be used to enter manipulate that collection of
mail items.

There is also the idea of a WEAK REFRENCE to a mail item or mbox, which means
that the user has a pointer to it, but it is NOT retained in any index of his,
and so may disappear.   If it is a mbox it is unlikely to disappear, and it is
possible to give another user a weak refrence to your mail directory.

In particular, users may have weak refrences to the TRIPOS mail directory, and
some user(s) may have a strong refrence, and thus be able to control it.

My main current concern is where to put the mboxes - they have been built so
that the user has to supply the PUID of the directory, and the INDEX for that
directory if full refrences are to be kept, so that it is not my problem when
the fileserver fills up with the inevitable old mail.
It would be trivial for me to create the directory and index for the mboxes, but
I would then get stamped on for allowing rubbish to accumulate.


Comments welcome.
