The documentation is aimed mostly at users with single character channels to
mailserver, but a 'line mode' method is available.

At certain times, the program may respond before a 'return' is typed. Often it
is possible to type on directly, and the desired effect is observered, but at
others, it is desireable to force the characters through without a newline, so
that the program can process them.  On many systems the character which is used
to force transmision is 'escape' (the 'standard' is DLE-T (i.e. CNTRL/P T)).
For this reason, in remote mode all 'escape' characters are ignored.

To further complicate things, many terminals commence their 'keypad' sequences
with 'escape', so the program uses 'escape' as it's initial META-character.
E.g. to clear the screen, use the META-charecter 'CLEAR SCEEN', which may be
types as 'ESC c'.  Note that ESC is used to differentiate it from 'escape',
as the character backquote (`) is used as the initial META-character on remote
lines.  Thus to clear the screen on a remote line, type three characters,
'backquote' c 'escape'.

If you cannot see the mail header, just a 'MS: ' prompt, then the mail command
will redisplay it.
