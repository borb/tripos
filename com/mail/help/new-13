Changes to the Mailserver:
V2.4.08 25 Mar 84
        More store for LSI4s (send should work)
        Experimental 'draft' feature added:
                If a SEND is abandoned due to FS troubles, then to the prompt
                'Source:', the switch 'draft' will cause the previously typed in
                message to be used as the text body.

V2.4.07 22 Mar 84
        MAIL -> OLD-MAILSERVER (SYSDESC only), TESTMAIL -> MAIL.
          i.e. if the current one fails, ask SM for 'SYSDESC OLD-MAILSERVER'.
        Help files once more available to be edited: some upgraded, suggestions
          for others accepted (especially in M/C readable format)
        Sender field from remote sites is now filled in, so reply (keypad-5)
          works.
        Additional fields added to header. These are not visable on the initial
          form (so as not to clutter it), but are avaliable when 'Source: ' is
          requested, or while inputting text, by use of keypad-7.
        The known domains are now: AC, UK.AC, ARPA, UUCP, MAILNET, BITNET and
          CSNET. Thus user%relay@ARPA.mc will be accepted.
        VTP upgrades, so that it works through the CUDN once more.

V2.4:   17 Mar 83
        Recovering from FS problem.
        Users are no longer created by sending them mail. Use the CREATE command
