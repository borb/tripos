REPLY   ITEM[/A],ABOUT=SUBJECT/K[,from=file/k]              Reply to a mail item

        This is similar to send, except that the recipient is the sender of the
specified mail item, and the subject defaults to that of the received item.
If a current message is selected, then ITEM defaults to that value.

        Note that users may not see the mail immediately as the MAILSERVER
caches the master tables.
