PRINT number,,,,,,,,,TITAN.ROOM/s,MOND/s,Canon/s,Service/k,ALL/s      Print mail

        Prints out the specified mail items at the specified printer (default is
    the canon printer in the titan room)
        If no argument is given, and an item is selected, that item is printed.
        If only the flag ALL is quoted, then all items are printed
        Otherwise the selected items are printed. Each selection may be a single
    number, m-n which will print items m to n, or * to indicate the previous
    selection

        If a service name is given, then the selected messages are sent to that
    ring service. Thus if the machine delta is allocated to you,  the command
        'print 3-5 service write-delta/dev:dir.file'
    will save messages 3-5 in the file 'dev:dir.file' on delta.
