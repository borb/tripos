This is the MAIL directory for development work.
================================================

The directories are:
MOBJ:   <mctype2>-obj   Object modules/system syslink file
        bcp             Sources that are different from the version in :COM.MAIL
        [header         altered header file]

To compile (you must use BCP) you must set
G1:     :com.mail
so that it can pick up unaltered files. Also stack shoul be set to 1300 (?).
To compile it on LSI4s YOU MUST HAVE A VERY BARE MACHINE !!!
To do this (if you have an init sequence) type CTRL-C before (return) after your
pasdsword.

The command 'C M' will do a complete make. It indirects through :pb.mail.make-c
which is the file that knows which sources have been modified, and will thus
need to be altered.

There are further command commands in :com.mail.s.

The object names are:
        <name>  Standard
        c<name> Command version
        d<name> Demon version
