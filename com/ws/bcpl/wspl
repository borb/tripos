// This section allows WS to call the PL lisp interpreter and the
// interpreter to control useful editing operations inside WS.

// somewhat dud version, as PL is not fully implemented yet.

// We communicate with PL via the "start" global -
// The first call is init
// others are 'read' , 'help' or 'finish' in that order
// for the former two return yes if error, else no
